        Appetizer Course
        An appetizer is a small dish of an overall meal. It can also be a drink or multiple drinks containing alcohol. Common examples include: shrimp cocktail, calamari, salad, potato skins, mussels, bruschetta or cheese and crackers. An appetizer may also be very elegant in some restaurants.

        They are often referred to as snacks or hors d'oeuvres. Arguably, one fundamental, unspoken, purpose of appetizers, especially in a restaurant setting, is to keep hungry people fed until the main dish is served.
        An appetizer in the French cuisine is a very important matter, and in all restaurants you will find tiny portions of sophisticated food as appetizers. They are called entrées and the word is commonly used for appetizers in other fancy restaurants across the world. Among the finest appetizers, you can taste all types of famous French cheeses, like the camembert cheese, with select wines, as well as lemon pesto zucchini peppers. Other appetizers found in fancy restaurants as well as in local dinners, are the broccoli and olive spread, goat cheese stuffed tomatoes, land the croustades with Duxelles. Appetizers may also include the famous foie gras, liver of a force-fed duck or goose, and pâtés. Pâté represents a mixture of grounded meats with meat fats, game or liver, herbs and spices. Pâté en croûte is pâté inside of a pastry crust and makes for a delicious appetizer served with white wine.

        Different types of foods can be acquired by unlocking recipes/cuisines from many real-life cultures in Restaurant Tycoon 2. Though not specific to a cuisine, drinks are attainable the same way.

        First, to unlock a cuisine, you have to create a restaurant, with the cuisines being shared between all restaurants. When you unlock a new menu, there will be locked foods that you will have to unlock by purchasing food boxes that contain new recipes within the unlocked cuisines.

        Due to the realism, there are 3 levels to a full course in Restaurant Tycoon 2, similar to many sit down real life restaurants. Customers will have the option to choose Starter to start their meal course at your restaurant. Then, they will order their primary meal, the Main Courses. After that, their final option is to order Dessert. Not all customers will order a starter or dessert dish. An entrée in modern French table service and that of much of the English-speaking world (apart from the United States and parts of Canada) is a dish served before the main course of a meal. Outside North America, it is generally synonymous with the terms hors d'oeuvre, appetizer or starter. It may be the first dish served, or it may follow a soup or other small dish or dishes. In the United States and parts of Canada, the term entrée refers to the main dish or the only dish of the meal.

        The main course is the featured or primary dish in a meal consisting of several courses. It usually follows the entrée ("entry") course.
        The main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish in a meal. The main ingredient is usually meat, fish or another protein source. It is most often preceded by an appetizer, soup or salad, and followed by a dessert. For those reasons the main course is sometimes referred to as the "meat course".The courses following the main course then calm the palate and the stomach, acting as a sort of dénouement or anticlimax.

        In formal dining, a well-planned main course can function as a sort of gastronomic apex or climax. In such a scheme, the preceding courses are designed to prepare for and lead up to the main course in such a way that the main course is anticipated and, when the scheme is successful, increased in its ability to satisfy and delight the diner. The courses following the main course then calm the palate and the stomach, acting as a sort of dénouement or anticlimax.
        The main course is food that is served as the main dish in a multi-course meal.[1] It is often served after the entrée. In the United States, the main course may be called the "entrée".
        The main course is usually the biggest dish on a menu. The main ingredient is often meat or fish. It most often follows an appetizer, soup, or salad, and is often followed by a dessert.
